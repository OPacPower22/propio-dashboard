Project Description: Call Tracking Dashboard

-- Overview --

The Call Tracking Dashboard is a web-based interface designed to help users view, filter, and analyze their received calls within a specific date range. The dashboard provides real-time insights into the total earnings from received calls and includes essential call control actions such as starting, stopping, and editing active calls.

-- Key Features --

 * Call List Display: Shows a detailed table of received calls, including date, duration, and cost in USD.
 * Date Filtering: Users can select a start and end date to filter calls within a specific period.
 * Earnings Summary: Displays the total earnings from received calls within the selected timeframe.
 * Call Status Controls: Includes three buttons to start, stop, and edit active calls.
 * Interactive UI: A clean, responsive design for seamless navigation.
 
-- Technologies Used --

    HTML5 → For structuring the user interface
    CSS3 → For styling and layout design
    JavaScript (ES6) → For interactive functionality and data filtering

-- How It Works --

    View Calls: The dashboard loads a predefined list of calls.
    Filter Calls: Users can select a date range to display calls within that period.
    Calculate Total USD: The system automatically calculates the total earnings from filtered calls.
    Control Calls: Users can start, stop, or edit active calls using dedicated buttons.

-- Possible Enhancements --

 * API Integration → Fetch real-time call data dynamically
 * Dark Mode → Improve user experience with a toggleable dark theme
 * Charts & Analytics → Display call trends using visual graphs
 * Export Data → Allow users to download call reports as CSV or PDF
 * Final Thoughts

This project provides an intuitive and efficient way for users to monitor and manage their received calls, while also keeping track of earnings. With additional improvements, it can be expanded into a fully functional call analytics platform.

Future-ready, scalable, and user-friendly!
